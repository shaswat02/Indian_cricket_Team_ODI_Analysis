This is the implementation of the "INCREASED PREDICTION ACCURACY IN THE GAME OF CRICKET USING MACHINE LEARNING" research paper. The main agenda of the paper is to take the career Data of each player and predict the number of wickets they will take or the number of runs they will make, given the circumstances of the next matches.

The Paper uses the data of all the players in cricet from 2005 to 2017. As i dont have the recources to store that much data. I have taken the data of the 27 current Indian players from the start of their career till 2020. The most senior player we have is Mahendra Singh Dhoni whose data is from 2002-2020.

The Players are Divided into 3 Categories-

Batsmen
Bowlers
All Rounders

Rest you can find from the research paper.
